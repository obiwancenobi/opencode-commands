You are executing the `/create-pr` command to commit all changes, push, and create a pull request. Follow this workflow:

## Pre-flight Checks

1. **Verify Git Configuration**
   - Run: Bash(git config user.name)
     If empty: "Git user not configured. Set git config user.name first."
   - Run: Bash(git config user.email)
     If empty: "Git user not configured. Set git config user.email first."

2. **Check Branch and Remote**
   - Run: Bash(git branch --show-current)
   - Run: Bash(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "no-remote")
   - If branch is main, master, develop, or release/*: warn user before proceeding
   - If no remote: "No remote configured. Add a remote with: git remote add origin YOUR_URL"

   **If on Protected Branch:**
   Ask in chat:
   ```
   You are on a protected branch. What would you like to do?

   1. Push Anyway — Push directly from protected branch
   2. Create Branch — Create a new branch with conventional naming and push there
   3. Cancel — Abort the operation

   Reply with the number.
   ```

   If user chooses "Create Branch":
   - Suggest branch name: feat/short-description (infer from commit intent)
   - Confirm branch name with user
   - Run: Bash(git checkout -b feat/your-branch-name)
   - Proceed with push workflow on new branch

## Phase 1: Push All Changes

### 1. Read All Changes
Run in parallel:
- Run: Bash(git status)
- Run: Bash(git diff --cached --stat)
- Run: Bash(git diff --cached)
- Run: Bash(git diff --stat)
- Run: Bash(git diff)
- Run: Bash(git log --oneline -5)

### 2. Analyze Changes
- All files changed (staged and unstaged)
- Full diff of all changes
- Remote URL context

### 3. Generate Commit Message
- Format: type(scope): subject
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf
- Subject: under 72 chars, imperative mood, no period

### 4. Present Push Confirmation
Ask in chat:
```
Commit message ready. Stage all, commit, and push?

1. Accept — Stage all, commit, and push to remote
2. Suggest Again — Generate an alternative commit message
3. Cancel — Abort the operation

Reply with the number.
```

### 5. Handle Push Response
- If response = "Accept": Run Bash(git add . && git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE" && git push origin $(git branch --show-current))
- If upstream missing: Bash(git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current))
- If response = "Suggest Again": Generate new message, present again
- If response = "Cancel": Abort with "Operation cancelled."

### 6. Skip Push If Already Clean
- If nothing to commit and already pushed: skip to Phase 2

## Phase 2: Create Pull Request

### 7. Gather PR Context
Run in parallel:
- Run: Bash(git branch --show-current)
- Run: Bash(git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git log --oneline -10)
- Run: Bash(git diff origin/main...HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff origin/master...HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --stat -10)
- Run: Bash(git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --stat origin/master...HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "")

### 8. Detect Base Branch
- Run: Bash(git remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep 'HEAD branch' | awk '{print $NF}')
- Default to main if not found

### 9. Generate PR Title and Body
- Title: Same as commit message subject line (type(scope): subject)
- Body sections:
  - ## Summary: Brief description of changes
  - ## Changes: Bullet list of key changes from diff
  - ## Test Plan: Suggested testing steps

### 10. Check GitHub CLI Availability
- Run: Bash(which gh 2>/dev/null)
- If not found:
  - Run: Bash(brew --version 2>/dev/null) (check if Homebrew available)
  - Ask in chat:
    ```
    GitHub CLI (gh) is not installed. What would you like to do?

    1. Install gh — Run 'brew install gh' (requires 'gh auth login' after)
    2. Open in Browser — Skip gh, open PR compare URL in browser to create manually
    3. Cancel — Abort without creating PR

    Reply with the number.
    ```
  - If user chooses "Install gh": Run Bash(brew install gh), then check auth
  - If install fails or user chooses "Open in Browser": go to step 13
- If found, check auth:
  - Run: Bash(gh auth status 2>&1)
  - If not authenticated:
    Ask in chat:
    ```
    GitHub CLI is not authenticated. What would you like to do?

    1. Login to gh — Run 'gh auth login' to authenticate
    2. Open in Browser — Skip gh, open PR compare URL in browser to create manually
    3. Cancel — Abort without creating PR

    Reply with the number.
    ```
  - If user chooses "Login to gh": Run Bash(gh auth login), then proceed
  - If auth fails or user chooses "Open in Browser": go to step 13

### 11. Present PR Confirmation (with gh)
Ask in chat:
```
PR ready to create. Review the details above.

1. Create PR — Create the pull request with the generated title and body
2. Edit Title — Provide a custom PR title
3. Edit Body — Provide a custom PR body
4. Cancel — Abort without creating PR

Reply with the number.
```

### 12. Create the PR via gh
- Run: Bash(gh pr create --title "TITLE" --body "BODY" --base BASE_BRANCH)
- If user chose "Edit Title": Ask for new title, then create
- If user chose "Edit Body": Ask for new body, then create
- Show PR URL from gh output
- Ask in chat:
  ```
  PR created successfully.

  1. Open in Browser — Open the PR in your default browser
  2. Done — Finish the workflow

  Reply with the number.
  ```

### 13. Fallback — Open PR Compare URL in Browser
- Detect platform from remote URL:
  - GitHub: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/compare/BASE...HEAD?expand=1&title=ENCODED_TITLE&body=ENCODED_BODY
  - GitLab: https://gitlab.com/OWNER/REPO/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request[source_branch]=HEAD&merge_request[target_branch]=BASE&merge_request[title]=ENCODED_TITLE&merge_request[description]=ENCODED_BODY
  - Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/OWNER/REPO/pull-requests/new?source=HEAD&dest=BASE
- Run: Bash(open "COMPARE_URL") (macOS) or Bash(xdg-open "COMPARE_URL") (Linux)
- Show the URL to the user as well

## Error Handling

- **Nothing to commit**: Skip to Phase 2, create PR for existing pushed commits
- **Staging failed**: "Failed to stage changes. Check file permissions."
- **Commit failed**: Show hook error and suggest fixes
- **Push rejected (remote ahead)**: Suggest pull first or force push (caution)
- **Push rejected (permissions)**: "Push rejected - permission denied"
- **gh not installed**: Offer to install with brew, or fall back to browser URL
- **gh not authenticated**: Offer gh auth login, or fall back to browser URL
- **No commits to create PR**: "No commits found on this branch to create a PR from."
- **PR creation failed**: Show gh error, offer to open browser URL as fallback
- **No remote tracking**: Suggest setting upstream with git push -u origin BRANCH
- **Unknown platform**: Show the compare URL pattern and let user open manually
