---

You are executing the `/generate-social-content` command. Generate social media content from user-provided context and distribute across selected platforms using parallel subagents. Follow this workflow:

## Step 1: Gather Context

Check if `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and non-empty:

- If provided: Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the topic/context
- If empty: Use question tool:
  - question: "Describe the feature, product, or topic you want to create social media content for."
  - header: "Content Topic"
  - options:
    - label: "Type Description"
      description: "I will type the context manually"
    - label: "Scan Project README"
      description: "Use the project README.md as the content source"

If user chooses "Scan Project README":
- Run: cat README.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_READMARY"
- If no README found: ask user to provide context manually
- Use the README content as the topic context

Save the topic context as `{TOPIC}` for use in later steps.

## Step 2: Ask Timezone

Use question tool:
- question: "What is your timezone? This is used to personalize best-time-to-post recommendations."
- header: "Timezone"
- options:
  - label: "America/New_York (EST/EDT)"
    description: "US East Coast"
  - label: "America/Los_Angeles (PST/PDT)"
    description: "US West Coast"
  - label: "Europe/London (GMT/BST)"
    description: "UK / Ireland"
  - label: "Asia/Tokyo (JST)"
    description: "Japan / Korea"
  - label: "Asia/Jakarta (WIB)"
    description: "Indonesia"
  - label: "Australia/Sydney (AEST)"
    description: "Australia East Coast"
  - label: "Europe/Berlin (CET/CEST)"
    description: "Central Europe"

Save the timezone as `{TIMEZONE}`.

## Step 3: Platform Selection

Use question tool:
- question: "Which social media platforms do you want to create content for? Select one or more."
- header: "Platforms"
- multiple: true
- options:
  - label: "LinkedIn"
    description: "Professional post, article teaser, or carousel idea"
  - label: "Twitter/X"
    description: "Thread or single tweet"
  - label: "Instagram"
    description: "Carousel, reel script, or story"
  - label: "Facebook"
    description: "Post or event announcement"
  - label: "TikTok"
    description: "Short video script (15-60s)"
  - label: "Reddit"
    description: "Value-driven post or AMA outline"
  - label: "YouTube"
    description: "Short video script or community post"

Save selected platforms as `{PLATFORMS}`.

## Step 4: Goal Selection

Use question tool:
- question: "What is the primary goal for this social media content?"
- header: "Content Goal"
- options:
  - label: "Brand Awareness"
    description: "Increase visibility and reach new audiences"
  - label: "Engagement"
    description: "Drive likes, comments, shares, and conversations"
  - label: "Lead Generation"
    description: "Capture leads and drive signups or demos"
  - label: "Product Launch"
    description: "Announce a new feature, product, or update"
  - label: "Education"
    description: "Teach the audience something valuable"
  - label: "Community Building"
    description: "Foster discussion and build a loyal following"

Save the goal as `{GOAL}`.

## Step 5: Derive Directory Name and Create Output

Derive a kebab-case directory name from `{TOPIC}`:
- Take the first 3-5 key words from the topic
- Convert to lowercase, hyphen-separated
- Example: "AI-powered code review tool for teams" → "ai-powered-code-review"

Run: mkdir -p "social-content/{DIRECTORY_NAME}"

After creating the directory, check for existing platform files:
Run: ls {OUTPUT_DIR}/*.md 2>/dev/null
If platform files already exist, each subagent will append a numeric suffix to avoid overwriting (e.g., `linkedin-2.md`).

Save the directory path as `{OUTPUT_DIR}`.

## Step 6: Launch Parallel Subagents

For each selected platform, launch a subagent using the Task tool. All subagent Task calls MUST be in a single message to run in parallel.

For each platform in `{PLATFORMS}`, call the Task tool with:

- subagent_type: general
- description: "Generate {PLATFORM} content"
- prompt: (see platform-specific prompts below)

(One row per platform with extracted info from each generated file)

## Posting Calendar

### Week 1
| Day | Time ({TIMEZONE}) | Platform | Content Summary |

- **No platforms selected**: "No platforms selected. Please select at least one social media platform."
- **Directory creation failed**: "Failed to create output directory. Check file permissions."
- **Subagent failed**: Report which platform subagent failed and suggest re-running for that platform individually.
- **README not found**: "No README.md found in project root. Please provide context manually."
